        "question": "There are 8 people seated in a circular table, facing the center. A is second to the left of B, who is directly opposite D. C is immediately to the right of E, who is third to the left of F. G is seated between H and A. If F is seated two seats to the right of H, and I is seated directly opposite B, who is seated third to the left of I?",

The second letters follow a forward alphabetical sequence: W, I, S, X. The third letters follow a reverse alphabetical sequence: E, O, D, C. The fourth letters follow a forward alphabetical sequence: R, P, F, V. The fifth letters follow a reverse alphabetical sequence: T, A, G, N. The pattern repeats the first letter of the previous term as the next term's first letter. Hence QWERTY."
