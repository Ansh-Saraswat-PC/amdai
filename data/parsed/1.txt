Module 1: ALPHANUMERIC SERIES AND BLOOD RELATIONS 

ALPHANUMERIC SERIES 

Q.1  How  many  such  vowels  are  there  in  the  above  arrangement  each  of  which  is 

immediately preceded by a consonant and immediately followed by a number 

Preceded- It means before 

Followed- It means After 

In the above question you have to find this- Consonant Vowels Number 

Common Mistake- Most of the candidates do this mistake in this kind of alphanumeric series is 

that they try to follow the sequence. But the correct method should be that you should find that 

character which  is  least in the series which  is  vowels here  i.e. A,E,I,O,U. So the pair would  be 

TE3, KA8, WI6 

Answer:Three 

Q.2  Which of the following is the seventh to the right of the twentieth from the right in the 

above arrangement? 

Concept- So when  in the question  you find two times right then substract the place  values  like 

here you would do 20 minus 7 and you will get 13 so now count 13th from the right end. 

If  you find the combination of left and right or right and left then add the place values. Now if 

you have a doubt that from which direction you will start counting then you have to count from 

the second element like if there is right left combination then you have to count from left. 

Q.3  What  should  come  in place  of  the  question  mark  in  the  following  series  based  on the 

above arrangement 

5*T 3$N K8I ? .QL 

Answer:2 # H 

When you have to find the missing element then try to crack the logic. In the above series there 

is a pattern that there is a gap of one element between the two characters given above. 

Q.4 Four of the following five are alike in a certain way with regard to their position in the 

above arrangement. Which is the one that does not belong to that group 

GUI, W64, 7J#, HMR, BVT 

now when you will find the word alike in such kind of series then you must be clear in your mind 

that you have to find odd one out 

Answer: W64 

Q.5 If we remove all the vowels in the series then which of the following element will be 7th 

from right end 

M 6 * I A 7 $ J # 5 4 B U 2 R Q D H L O @ P T E F 

Concept- Some candidates make a mistake that they write series after dropping the vowels and 

then count the elements but you don’t have to follow this approach. Just imagine that vowels are 

not present in the series and then count the elements 

Answer: D 

Q6 If words are arranged according to the alphabetical series from left to right then which 

word is third from the left 

YOM MJK UGJ IMX KQZ 

a)UGJ 

b)IMX 

c)KQZ 

d)MJK 

e) None of these 

Common  mistake- Due to the  pressure of  exam  some  candidates  starts  arranging  the  letters  in 

word  in  alphabetical  order  but  we  have  to  arrange  words  not  letters.  So  the  simple  concept  in 

these kind of questions which candidates need to follow is the first word will be the one whose 

first  letter  comes  before  the  others  similarly  you  have  to  arrange  all  the  words.  In  the  above 

problem the first word will be IMX.

Blood Relations 

BLOOD RELATIONS 

Blood Relationship issues are mostly concerned with a family's hierarchical structure, such as 

grandparents, parents, and children. There are several ties between family members of different 

generations. The full family tree must be established by charting out the numerous ties to answer 

such inquiries 

Family Tree 

 
 
 
 
One should be able to build a family tree to overcome difficulties with blood relations. 

A family tree is a diagram that depicts genealogical information. 

The following suggestions can assist you in creating a family tree. 

A circle represents all of the female members of the family. For convenience, the person's name 

is written inside the circle. 

A square represents each of the family's male members. 

For convenience, the person's name is written inside the square. 

A double-headed arrow is used to symbolize the relationship between two family members. 

The two ends of a double-headed arrow signify the marriage relationship. 

In the family tree, the upper generation is represented by all of the family members. For 

example, father, mother, uncle, aunt, and so on. In the family tree, the rationale may be extended 

by placing the grandparents above the parents. Grandfather and grandma, for example. 

In the middle of the family tree, all individuals of the same generation are depicted. For example, 

brothers, sisters, cousins, wives, husbands, and so on. 

The following generation's family members are reflected in the family tree below. For example, a 

daughter, a son, a niece, or a nephew.
